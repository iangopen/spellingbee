## 2026-09-30: rename to Spelling Bee on main

Renamed every user-facing "Spelling Race" to "Spelling Bee", ahead of the
redesign: `index.html` title and meta description, the `<h1>` on ModeSelect and
DifficultySelect, `README.md` and `PRIVACY.md`. The GitHub About description was
updated with `gh repo edit`; homepage and topics were kept.

Kept on purpose: the "Race" mode label, the repo slug, the `/spellingbee/` base,
all `spellingbee:*` localStorage keys, and the `package.json` name.

The meta description said "A word-spelling race game"; "race" is now dropped
there because it described the product, not the mode.

Not done: README screenshots (retaken after the redesign merges).
